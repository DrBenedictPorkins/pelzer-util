# About this file:
# This is the base file loaded during initialization of the PropertyManager class,
# a central part of the pelzer util system. This file has several conventions or special
# comment types, all of which start with the comment symbol '#'
# 1) #include <filename> : Acts as an include statement, importing the named file
#     as though it were copy-and-pasted into the file at the point of the include
# 2) #env something #vne : Allows subsets of the property system to be included in
#     smaller chunks for smaller jar distributions. 
#
# More info available in the documentation.
